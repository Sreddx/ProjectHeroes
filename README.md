# Project Humanity
Project Humanity is a third person action platformer dungeon crawler made in Unity. We took inspiration from games like Hades, Blue Fire, Risk of Rain 2 and Metroid Prime.
The project is ongoing and is currently being designed and developed.

# Multiplayer component
Project Humanity includes a prototype multiplayer mode that will be delivered as evidence for school project. Although it isn't a predesigned main feature it will showcase a potential new mode as well as our ability to implement multiplayer.
